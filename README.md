# Cartesi Machine Emulator

The Cartesi Machine Emulator is the reference off-chain implementation of the Cartesi Machine Specification. It's written in C/C++ with POSIX dependencies restricted to the terminal, process, and memory-mapping facilities. It is distributed as a library and scriptable in the Lua programming language.

The emulator implements RISC-V's RV64IMASU ISA. The letters after RV specify the extension set. This selection corresponds to a 64-bit machine, Integer arithmetic with Multiplication and division, Atomic operations, as well as the optional Supervisor and User privilege levels. In addition, Cartesi Machines support the Sv48 mode of address translation and memory protection.

### Requirements

- C++ Compiler with support for C++20 (tested with GCC >= 8+ and Clang >= 8.x).
- GNU Make >= 3.81
- Lua >= 5.4.4
- Libslirp >= 4.6.0
- Boost >= 1.81

Obs: Please note that Apple Clang Version number does not follow upstream LLVM/Clang.

#### Debian Bookworm

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential wget git clang-tidy-16 clang-format-16 \
        libboost1.81-dev libssl-dev libslirp-dev \
        ca-certificates pkg-config lua5.4 liblua5.4-dev \
        luarocks

sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luasocket
sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luasec
sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luaposix
```

For more information, see the [Configuring Lua 5.4](#configuring-lua-54) section.

#### MacOS

##### MacPorts

```bash
sudo port install clang-16 boost181 wget pkgconfig lua54 lua-luarocks libslirp

sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luasocket
sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luasec
sudo luarocks install --lua-version=5.4 luaposix
```

For more information, see the [Configuring Lua 5.4](#configuring-lua-54) section.

##### Homebrew

```bash
brew install llvm@16 boost wget pkg-config openssl lua luarocks libslirp

luarocks --lua-dir=$(brew --prefix)/opt/lua install luasocket
luarocks --lua-dir=$(brew --prefix)/opt/lua install luasec
luarocks --lua-dir=$(brew --prefix)/opt/lua install luaposix
```

For more information, see the [Configuring Lua 5.4](#configuring-lua-54) section.

##### Configuring Lua 5.4

For emulator scripts to function properly, it is necessary for the lua5.4 binary to be available in the system PATH. If your operating system or package manager provides a Lua binary under a different name (e.g., lua instead of lua5.4, which is common on Homebrew), you will need to create a symbolic link or an alias named lua5.4. This can be done as follows:

```bash
ln -s $(which lua) /usr/local/bin/lua5.4  # Create a symbolic link (adjust as needed for your system)
# or
alias lua5.4='lua'  # Create an alias (add this line to your shell profile file like .bashrc or .zshrc)
```

###### Setting Up LuaRocks Modules

To use features that require LuaRocks modules, you must ensure your environment is configured to find these modules. Export the output of `luarocks path --lua-version=5.4` to your environment by executing them or adding it to your .bashrc or .zshrc file. E.g.:

```bash
eval "$(luarocks path --lua-version=5.4)"
```

This command adjusts the environment variables for your shell sessions, ensuring LuaRocks-installed modules are correctly discovered by Lua scripts.

### Build

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j3 https://github.com/cartesi/machine-emulator.git
make
```

Cleaning:

```bash
make clean
```

Microarchitecture:

If you want to use a pre-built uarch RAM image instead of building one, use the variable `UARCH_RAM_IMAGE` to specify the path to the desired image file.

```bash
$ make UARCH_RAM_IMAGE=<path-to-your-uarch-ram.bin>
```

### Install

```bash
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

### Build C libraries in standalone

Both `libcartesi` and `libcartes_jsonrpc` C libraries can be compiled in standalone, either as static or shared library:

```bash
make bundle-boost
make -C src libcartesi.a libcartesi_jsonrpc.a libcartesi.so libcartesi_jsonrpc.so
```

The `.a` and `.so` files will be available in `src` directory, you can use any of them to link your application.

You can even use other toolchains to cross compile targeting other platforms:

```bash
# Target WASM with Emscripten toolchain
make -C src \
  CC=emcc CXX=em++ AR="emar rcs" \
  libcartesi.a

# Target WASM with WASI SDK toolchain
make -C src \
  CC=/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang CXX=/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang++ AR="/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/llvm-ar rcs" \
  libcartesi.a

# Target Windows with mingw-w64 toolchain
make -C src \
  CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
  AR="x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar rcs" \
  libcartesi.a
```

## Running Tests

To build and execute the all tests run:

```bash
make build-tests-all
make test
```

To execute the machine test suite run:

```bash
make build-tests-machine-with-toolchain
make test-machine
```

To execute the uarch test suite run:

```bash
make build-tests-uarch-with-toolchain
make test-uarch
```

## Linter

We use clang-tidy 15 as the linter.

### Install

#### Debian Bookworm

You need to install the package clang-tidy-16 and set it as the default executable with update-alternatives.

```bash
apt install clang-tidy-16
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-tidy clang-tidy /usr/bin/clang-tidy-16 120
```

### Running Lint

```bash
make lint -j$(nproc)
```

## Code format

We use clang-format to format the code base.

### Install

#### Debian Bookworm

You need to install the package clang-format-16 and set is as the default executable with update-alternatives.

```bash
apt install clang-format-16
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-format clang-format /usr/bin/clang-format-16 120
```

### Formatting code

```bash
make format
```

### Checking whether the code is formatted

```bash
make check-format
```

## Coverage

### Dependencies

#### Debian Bookworm

If you want to run the GCC-based coverage, you should install the lcov package with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install lcov
```

If you want to run the clang-based coverage, you should install the clang package with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install clang llvm
```

### Compilation

Before running the coverage, you should build the emulator with the flag coverage-toolchain=gcc or coverage-toolchain=clang.
Make sure you run `make clean` to clean up any previous compilation.
For GCC-based coverage run the following command.

```bash
make coverage=yes COVERAGE_TOOLCHAIN=gcc -j$(nproc)
make build-tests-all coverage=yes COVERAGE_TOOLCHAIN=gcc -j$(nproc)
```

For clang-based coverage run the following command.

```bash
make coverage=yes COVERAGE_TOOLCHAIN=clang -j$(nproc)
make build-tests-all coverage=yes COVERAGE_TOOLCHAIN=clang -j$(nproc)
```

### Running coverage

After building the emulator with coverage enable, you should run the following command.
For instance:

```bash
make test coverage-report coverage=yes COVERAGE_TOOLCHAIN=gcc
```

This command will generate a coverage report in the src directory.
For clang coverage, repeat the same command but with the flag coverage-toolchain=clang.
